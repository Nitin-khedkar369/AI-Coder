**AI-based Chatbot for Learning Programming**
This project is an AI-based chatbot designed to assist users in learning programming concepts, solving coding problems, and answering technical queries. The chatbot leverages advanced language models (LLMs) to provide a context-aware Q&A experience and offers the ability to execute code for programming-related queries.

Features
Context-aware Q&A: Understands user queries in programming and provides detailed, accurate responses.
Code Execution: Runs code snippets for supported programming languages and returns the output directly in the chat interface.
Knowledge Retrieval: Retrieves relevant information from a custom knowledge base using embeddings and vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB).
User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit to offer an intuitive and responsive user interface for seamless interactions.
Tech Stack
LangChain: For building the conversational logic and integrating the LLM.
Llama (qwen2.5-coder:7b): For generating natural language responses.
